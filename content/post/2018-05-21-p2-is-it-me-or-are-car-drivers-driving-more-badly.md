* Besides the usual:
    * turning left on a red (if the light is yellow then you are not supposed to enter an intersection folks!)
    * not stopping at a stop sign
<!--more-->
* I see more:
    * lights not working (especially brake lights) or lights off at night or when it's raining
    * people not turning on their day time running lights (DRLs) (I didn't realize you could turn DRLs off :-) ?!?!?)
    * people not signaling their turns which is super dangerous when driving a car
    * people double parking
    * people parking on the wrong side of the street especially around schools
    * nobody seems to have any idea how to drive on a roundabout! (it's not that hard if  you are going left you signal left, if you are going right you signal right and you yield to traffic on the roundabout!)
* I don't think people riding bicycles are any more or less dangerous in the last few years unlike folks driving cars, what I do see is:
    * no lights at night (people pay $30/month for phone data plans but they can't afford a nice and bright $50 front and $50 back light?!?!?)
    * and of course not stopping or signaling (but far less dangerous and numerous than folks driving cars)
