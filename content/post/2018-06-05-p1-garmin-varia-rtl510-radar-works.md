* Bought the [Varia RTL 510 Radar](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/04/garmin-varia-rtl510-radar-cycling-light-in-depth-review.html) and an Edge 130 computer a couple of weeks ago.
* Works great! Now I want a colour Garmin computer!
* Can't wait until there is competition and other companies support radar!
