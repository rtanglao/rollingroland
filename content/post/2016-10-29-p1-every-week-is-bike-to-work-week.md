Buy the right gear and lights and every week is bike to work week!

<!--more-->

## Pontifications

* Every week is [bike to work week](https://bikehub.ca/bike-to-work). Especially in Vancouver. Except for the 1-5 days a year when it is snowy or icy.
* You just have to have the right gear. And the gear doesn't have to be expensive. More in a future post!
* Finally you need lights. Again lights don't have to be expensive. Blinkies for daylight. And lights "to see" when it is rainy or night time or winter! Again not expensive (especially compared to the cost of time off because somebody doesn't see you) and cheap compared to things we waste money on like expensive caf√© coffee (I'm one of those people!). Again more in a future post.
