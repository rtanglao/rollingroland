tl;dr: If it's raining and over 5 degrees, I wear: crocs, maloja waterproof bicycling shorts (with wicking underwear), gloves, Dish and Duer rain shield vest. If it's raining hard I add a happy days rain cape .

## Pontifications

* [Crocs (with holes and without socks) as previously blogged](http://rollingroland.com/post/2016-11-02-p1-no-socks-bicycle-to-work-in-the-rain/).
* [Maloja water resistant bicycling shorts](http://www.maloja.de/collection/summer2016/2,9,41,181/Men/Activities/Mountain%20Bike%20Freeride/DonaldM.html) with 2 amazing large zippered pockets (with wicking underwear in case the water gets through from MEC or Mark's)
* [Dish and Duer Stay Dry Rain Vest Rinse](https://dishandduer.com/product/stay-dry-vest-rinse/) (the [blazer](https://dishandduer.com/product/stay-dry-blazer-rinse/) is good if you don't sweat as much as I do) with a polypropylene wicking short sleeve shirt (you may want a long sleeve if you don't sweat as much as I do, i would get a zip neck long sleeve because you sweat more than you think and the zipper will come in handy for ventilation; mine are from MEC)
* Gloves (I use [SealkSkinz](https://www.sealskinz.com/US/gloves) but any water resistant glove will do)
* If it's raining cats and dogs I add a [happy rainy days rain cape](http://happyrainydays.com/us/) (but the above stuff will handle it too! it's just a question of how wet you want your legs and arms to be and yes I wear a discontinued pink ladies cape :-) !)
