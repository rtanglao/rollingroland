**tl;dr**: Snowmaggedon Day 36 (since December 5th, 2016) means no bicycling to work for me in the last 5 weeks :-(

## Pontifications

* It started snowing on December 5, 2016
* It is now January 9, 2017
* That is 36 days by my reckoning
* I haven't been able to bike since before December 5 since Woodland from Clark Park north to Adana has been icy, and snowy.
* Last Tuesday January 3rd it was totally ice so much so that it was dangerous to walk.
* Here are some photos of day 36 from my walk Clark Park to Gaston: <br />
